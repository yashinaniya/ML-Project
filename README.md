# Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide solutions for Kaggle's Data Science competitions .
It also includes solutions for other projects on Machine learning alogorithms.
I'll keep updating the readme file as I upload more projects solution

As of now, the solutions to three projects are provided:

- Kaggle: Titanic survival prediction
- Kaggle: Housing Price prediction using SVM and advance regression technique
- Energy Output prediction for a power plant using ANN

## Procedure

The tasks required to solve in the datasets are proceded in the following manner:

- Import Libraries and Load Dataset
- Numerical Summary
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Train-Test Split
- Model Development
- Further Discussion

## Links to Dataset:

You can download the datasets either from this repo itself or they can be found here:

- [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- [Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- [Combined Power plant dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant)
